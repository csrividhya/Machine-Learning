Hi! Please find attached the source files linear_brain_hinge.py and linear_brain_logistic.py which have the same code but just differ in the parameters they compute. The codes test for 12 different combinations of lamda and learning rate and this nested for loop part(right before the main()) has been commented. Uncomment this loop, if you want to run the code for the combinations of lamda and learning rate values. 

To execute: python linear_brain_hinge.py

Also, attached is a report which contains accuracy values got for different combinations of lambda and learning rate. 

Also, the folder "OUTPUT" contains output .txt files.

Thank you!
